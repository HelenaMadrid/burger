Eat The Burger!
## How does it works?

Eat The Burger is an app where you can add a burger and then devour it. 

## How can I use it?

Whenever you add a burger it will be displayed on the left side awaiting to be devoured. Once devoured, the burger will be display on the right side.

If no burger name is written, then the users will receive a message error urging them to complete that field before adding.
